# web-scraping-challenge

This repository contains:
* A python script to scrape 4 different web pages with Mars facts, News and Images. For scrapping, I use splinter and beautiful soup, and to store the information I use MongoDB.(mission_to_mars.ipynb)
* An html script template to present the data in a new web page. (templates/index)
* A python script with a function to run the web-scrapping code, and which runs when a botton is click in the server-page to refresh the information.(scrape_mars.py)
* An app script that retrieves the info from Mongo and pushes it into the server-web page.(app.py)
* The server page with the app results. (images/screenshots)
